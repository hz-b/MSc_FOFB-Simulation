# Simulation FOFB

## What is that?

This is the repository I used to build my simulations.

You can find:

* at the root of the folder: some Python and MATLAB scripts for TF identification, controller design and simulation.
* in `data`: the generatated/measured data
* the `mysignal` python module for signal processing

## Dependencies

`scipy.signal`, `control.robust` and `search_kicks` (see other MSc-related
repositories for the latter).
